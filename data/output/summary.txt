Learn to define large language models, or LLMs, describe LLM use cases, explain prompt tuning, and describe Google's Gen AI development tools. Large language models are a subset of deep learning. To find out more about deep learning, see our introduction to generative AI course video. Large language models refer to large general-purpose language models that can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data. If you need a special service dog, such as a police dog, a guide dog, or a hunting dog, you add special trainings. The similar idea applies to large language models. These models are trained for general purposes to solve common language problems.
